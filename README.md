# Crowd behaviour modeling

Our work focuses on re-implementing the ProactiveCrowd model as seen in article: [ProactiveCrowd: Modelling Proactive Steering Behaviours
for Agent-Based Crowd Simulation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319974710_ProactiveCrowd_Modelling_Proactive_Steering_Behaviours_for_Agent-Based_Crowd_Simulation_Modelling_Proactive_Steering_for_Agent-Based_Crowd_Simulation). The reference model includes two implemented behaviors - gap-seeking and following. In our work we reimplemented the existing model from scratch and extended it with two new behaviors - stop-and-go and overtaking to make our crowd simulation even more realistic.

## Running the simulation:
1. Download [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) (LTS release 2020.3.22f1 or higher).
2. Clone this repository and open the project in Unity.
3. Select one of two possible scenes (Lane or Intersection) and run the simulation by pressing play button.
